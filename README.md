# My Portfolio

### Hello, I’m Aryan Solanki. I’m a computer science undergrad.

I'm currently deeply invested in machine learning, data science, and analytics. I am an Artificial Intelligence Major at the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar.

I like to read, write, and explore science, technology, and philosophy. I spent my summer break as a Data Science Intern at [Mobileware Technologies](https://mobilewaretech.com/). Presently, I am serving as the Finance and Admin Coordinator at my college’s Technical Summit, Amalthea. I enjoy playing the drums and swimming in my free time.

## Work Experience

### Data Science Intern, Mobileware Technologies
**AWS Bedrock, Generative AI, and Machine Learning**

* Designed and implemented a Retrieval-based (RAG) real-time chat agent to facilitate conversational interactions for financial transactions.
* Researched approaches to address latency in error troubleshooting for financial logs.
* Conducted in-depth research on large language models (LLMs) and explored the intersection of finance and generative AI (GenAI).

## Essays

I love finding answers but, more importantly, I love asking the right questions - about literally everything. I write mainly about STEM and self-growth. I also share my life learnings and document all incredible things that come my way.
